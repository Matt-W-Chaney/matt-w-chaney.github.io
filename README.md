Predicted daily COVID-19 deaths in North Carolina using polynomial time series regression. Achieved 1.34% Mean Absolute Percentage Error across a 42-day forecast window (1.20% for weekly predictions).  
- Polynomial time series regression and error evaluation methods are used in manufacturing for production planning, inventory forecasting, and demand prediction.

**Psychological Mediation Analysis**  
Used multiple regression and indirect effect testing to demonstrate that self-control significantly mediated the effect of chronic rejection on trait aggression.  
- Multiple regression and mediation analysis are valuable in manufacturing for identifying root causes, understanding interdependent process factors, and optimizing system-wide outcomes through data-informed decision pathways.

Applied Fourier transformation to 600 days of stellar light curve data, identifying a dominant ~2.2-day periodic cycle consistent with expected orbital patterns.  
- Fourier transformation is widely used in manufacturing for signal processing, vibration analysis, and anomaly detection to enable predictive maintenance and real-time monitoring of machinery and production systems.

**Housing Price Prediction**  
Predicted home sale prices using linear regression and an MLP neural network, explaining up to 88% of price variation through feature engineering and model tuning.  
- Linear regression, neural networks, and feature engineering are core techniques for cost estimation, production yield prediction, and process optimization. This supports accurate forecasting and strategic planning in manufacturing operations.

**Handwritten Digit Classification**  
Trained a logistic regression classifier to correctly identify handwritten numbers with 96% accuracy, using feature scaling, cross-validation, and performance evaluation.  
- Logistic regression, feature scaling, and cross-validation are used in visual inspection, defect classification, and automated quality control systems to enhance precision and reduce inspection time.

**Image Compression with SVD**  
Applied singular value decomposition (SVD) to compress image data, reducing data size by over 80% through dimensionality reduction, while maintaining visual quality.  
- SVD and dimensionality reduction are used in manufacturing to compress sensor or image data, enabling faster processing, reduced storage costs, and efficient transmission in real-time monitoring systems.

**Evolutionary Strategy Optimization for the 100 Prisoners Problem**  
Built an evolutionary algorithm with custom fitness functions and expression trees combining deterministic and stochastic logic to evolve interpretable strategies, improving success rates from ~0% to over 30% by autonomously discovering the optimal solution.  
- Evolutionary algorithms and custom fitness functions are used in manufacturing to optimize production schedules, resource allocation, and control strategies. This supports adaptive, data-driven decision-making in complex systems.
